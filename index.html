        <h2>English Proofreader and Copyeditor</h2>
        <section class="content">
            <p>As an author, you have spent months and maybe years gathering data and conducting your analysis to produce your paper/thesis/etc. but you’re afraid of getting rejected by the journal or of getting roasted at the examination panel due to poor language. </p>
            <p>You’ve sent the paper to many friends whose English are supposedly good to have a look on the paper, and you’ve even sent it to native speakers of English so that they polish your language, yet they all fix just very minor errors and you still feel that’s way far from error-free language.</p>
            <p>You still feel something is missing; you keep saying to yourself, “Am I stuck with such poor presentation of my work and my paper’s language can’t get fixed or improved?</p>
            <p>What you don’t realize is that you don’t need native speakers of English and you don’t need to fire away as many copies as possible to as many friends as possible to help you improve your work’s language.</p>
            <p>What you really need is someone who has STUDIED English grammar and has been TRAINED in spotting even the minutest of errors in your paper and has EXPERIENCE in editing which develops an eagle eye that doesn’t miss any error in the paper. Only then can you trust them to get an error-free text.</p>
            <p>Assuming that a native English speaker is what you need to get an error-free paper is what’s keeping you from actually reaching that goal. Think about it for a second: let’s say you’re a native speaker of Arabic; would you be able to edit an Arabic-written text into error-free perfection in terms of language? Definitely NO! But a native speaker of Swahili who studied Arabic all his life and has been trained on editing Arabic will do a far better job! Don’t you think so?</p>

                    <p>English has been my passion since as far as I could remember. I’ve been studying English since I was four.  I studied English language and linguistics at Ain-Shams University Faculty of Languages (Al-Alsun), which is the top public school for languages across Egypt, and graduated 15 on my class (of 750+) with overall grade of Very Good (with hons).</p>
                    <p>I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in English linguistics as well from the same university with particular interest in Corpus linguistics as a tool to explore language use and development. Not only do I teach English, academic writing and research methods for a living at university level, but I have also been working as a copyeditor with renowned publishers.</p>
